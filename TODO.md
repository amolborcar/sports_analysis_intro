# Sports Analysis Project - TODO List

## Project Overview
Learning project for NBA data analysis using Cursor, with goal of building foundation for future DFS optimization project.

## Current Status: API Improvements Phase

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] **Setup NBA API Client** - Set up NBA API client for collecting player/team data
- [x] **API Foundation** - Add timeout handling, retry logic, and better error handling to NBA API client  

### ðŸš§ In Progress
#### API Improvements
- [ ] **Timeout Handling** - Add timeout handling to prevent hanging PTY issues (30s timeout implemented)
- [ ] **Retry Logic** - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed requests
- [ ] **Response Validation** - Add response validation to check data quality before processing
- [ ] **Intelligent Rate Limiting** - Implement adaptive rate limiting based on API response headers
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Move hardcoded values to config file/environment variables
- [ ] **Structured Logging** - Replace print statements with proper logging levels and JSON format

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks

#### Core Development
- [ ] **Database Design** - Design relational database schema for basketball data
- [ ] **Implement Database** - Implement database models and connection logic
- [ ] **Data Pipeline** - Create pipeline to scrape â†’ clean â†’ store data
- [ ] **Basic Analysis** - Build simple analysis examples using the stored data
- [ ] **Documentation** - Document the project structure and how to extend it

## Next Up
**Priority**: Implementing retry logic with exponential backoff to handle temporary API failures gracefully.

## Notes
- Using NBA API instead of scraping for reliable data access
- Building good git habits with feature branches
- All code changes going through proper git workflow
- Focus on learning Cursor, API integration, and database design
